Solving TSP


Execution #1/1

Seed: 1
Estimated max possible cost 6.000000
for path: 
0 1 0
Memory needed for path: 1 locs, for costs: 1 locs.
Desired precision: 1e+12
Mem constraint for cost_t: 16 bits
Rounded to pow of 2 bytes mem constraint (capped at 64bits) for cost_t: 16 bits
Bits needed for an int to preserve precision: 43
Warning: cannot preserve precision.
Warning: Using an integer; there is not enough memory for decimals.
Bits used per cost_t: 16
Selected cost_t = (u)int16_t
Solving with cost_t = t
Memory [GB] needed: 2.79397e-09
Requested precision is too high;managed to differentiate costs by: 0.000122
