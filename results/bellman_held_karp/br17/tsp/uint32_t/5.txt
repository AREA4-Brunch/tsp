Execution #1/1

Seed: 1
Estimated max possible cost 104.000000
for path: 
3 4 1 2 0 3
Memory needed for path: 0 locs, for costs: 24 locs.
Desired precision: 10000
Mem constraint for cost_t: 32 bits
Rounded to pow of 2 bytes mem constraint (capped at 64bits) for cost_t: 32 bits
Bits needed for an int to preserve precision: 20
Bits used per cost_t: 20
Selected cost_t = (u)int32_t
Solving with cost_t = j
