Estimated max possible cost 288.450076
for path: 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
Memory needed for path: 0 locs, for costs: 147 locs.
Desired precision: 1e+12
Mem constraint for cost_t: 64 bits
Rounded to pow of 2 bytes mem constraint (capped at 64bits) for cost_t: 64 bits
Bits needed for an int to preserve precision: 48
Warning: cannot preserve precision.
