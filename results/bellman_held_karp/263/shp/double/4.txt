Execution #1/1

Seed: 1
Estimated max possible cost 247.662769
for path: 
1 0 3 2 
Memory needed for path: 0 locs, for costs: 16 locs.
Desired precision: 1e+12
Mem constraint for cost_t: 64 bits
Rounded to pow of 2 bytes mem constraint (capped at 64bits) for cost_t: 64 bits
Bits needed for an int to preserve precision: 48
Warning: cannot preserve precision.
Selected cost_t = double
